# FoodMate

This is Food Mate, an open-source iOS app that lets users create, edit, share and search for recipes. It's an ongoing project I started Spring semester of my Freshman year (2015) to help familiarize myself with the Swift programming language and iOS development. I plan to keep adding to it and making it the best app I can. 

You will find that some features have not been implemented due to financial constraints. This is the same reason why this is will not be put on the iPhone App Store.

If anyone is interested in collaborating, send me an email at Jrl344@cornell.edu.
